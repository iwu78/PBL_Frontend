- Being a frontend, this repository is dedicated to developing efficent User interfaces and necessary files to fetch the backend URls and to host an efficient user interface. We have connected the Frontend and Backend via the concept of fetching the backend. We fetch links for specific APIs based on their registered blueprint name and URL prefix.

### Steganography
Steganography is a technique for hiding secret messages within other non-secret data. This project explores the art of steganography, allowing users to encode and decode messages within images, text, or audio files for covert communication. With advanced encryption techniques and secure data handling, Steganography provides a secure and reliable platform for hidden message exchange.
### Collabora
Collabora was ideated to address certain struggles that we and fellow students have experienced in their academic career. With several tests on a timely basis, there are often questions that we forget to ask our teachers in school and are frantically trying to figure out the solution the night before. Collabora acts as a mediator between teachers or experts of the topic in which the user can post a question publiclyin which teachers or experts can also see and answer those questions, other students also have the ability to answer the question which promotes peer to peer communication which is essential.
### Stock ML
Using foundational Machine Learning concepts, given the SP500 datasets I have created an ML model that once trained can be used to predict the viability of an investment and the probability that your money will increase in terms of the Stock. Created a UI which asks users for the opening price, closing price, highest price, high price, low price to effectively predict the viability of the users investment.

### Concussion Recovery Prediction Project
This project aims to provide personalized recovery recommendations for individuals experiencing symptoms following a concussion. The core functionality involves a web-based form where users can input the severity of their symptoms. The backend processes this data to generate a total score and specific recommendations based on the symptom severity.

Key Features:
Symptom Input Form:

Users select the severity of various symptoms (e.g., Headache, Neck Pain, Nausea) from a predefined list.
The form is dynamically generated and organized into three columns for better user experience.
Symptom Scoring:

Each symptom has an associated weight, and the severity is mapped to a numerical value.
The total score is calculated by multiplying the symptom weight by the severity value.
The total score and individual symptom scores are used to determine the severity of the condition.
Recommendations Generation:

Based on the scores, the system generates specific recommendations to aid in recovery.
Recommendations are tailored to the severity of each symptom and include general advice as well as medical guidance for more severe cases.
The recommendations are displayed below the form upon submission.
User Interface:

The interface is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a clean layout and responsive design.
Background and styling elements provide a calming and professional appearance, enhancing the overall user experience.
This project combines frontend user interaction with backend data processing to deliver a helpful tool for individuals recovering from a concussion. The system leverages medical guidelines and best practices to offer actionable advice, supporting users in their recovery journey.
